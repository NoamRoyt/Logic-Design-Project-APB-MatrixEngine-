Matrix Manipulation and Binary Conversion Toolkit Overview

This Python script is designed to facilitate the generation of matrix calculations and control instructions for the APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) protocol.
It generates test matrices and corresponding APB bus instructions that can be used in hardware simulations, particularly in Verilog environments.
The script also manages scratchpad memory which is instrumental in validating the outcomes against expected results in matrix processing applications.

Features
Matrix Calculation: Generate matrices for various arithmetic operations and manipulate their dimensions as needed.
APB Instruction Generation: Create APB bus-compatible control instructions to interface with hardware simulations.
Scratchpad Memory Management: Generate and manage scratchpad memory data to facilitate comparison between simulated and expected results.
File Handling: Outputs matrix data, control instructions, and scratchpad memory contents into designated files for easy integration and verification in simulation environments.
